# Caesar_Cipher
A simple C++ Console Application that Applies the Caesar Cipher on a User Inputed String

The code as of now only allows the use of characters, upper and lower.
The complexity of code is due to the fact that the input is converted to ASCII values
I will be adding in the ability to shift all values of the ASCII table soon
The output is still being worked on and is in no way final
Everything in the source code is a work in progress!!!

This is still a work in progress as I complete my classes in C++
