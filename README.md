# Caesar_Cipher
A simple C++ Console Application that Applies the Caesar Cipher on a User Inputed String

The code as of now only allows the use of characters, upper and lower.
The complexity of code is due to the fact that the input is converted to ASCII values
I will be adding in the ability to shift all values of the ASCII table soon
The output is still being worked on and is in no way final
Everything in the source code is a work in progress!!!

As of now this reflects my progress on my first programming class, which is
currently based off of the book:
  "C++ Programming From Problem Analysis to Program Design"
  By D.S. Malik
  
I will not be using any code from the book in here for profits or any personel
gain, this is strictly for learning and positive feedback.
 If I have violated any copyright laws I will gladly remove any code.

This is still a work in progress as I complete my classes in C++
